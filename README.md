( Be sure to add the `s` after `http` when you change the pic or it won't appear )
```css
/*First Background*/
.app {
    background-image: url("https://i.imgur.com/jCO8sAy.png") !important;
    background-size: cover !important;
}
/*Second Background*/
.callout-backdrop {
    opacity:0.9!important;
    background: url("https://i.imgur.com/eeDIMtw.jpg")!important;
    background-size: cover !important;
    background-position: center !important;
}
```
P.S. This theme is still new so there might still be some wrong colors but fear not! Just notify me and it will be fixed.
